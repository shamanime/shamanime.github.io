My name is Jefferson Queiroz Venerando, also known as shamanime. I'm a software engineer living in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

I've attended the Fundação Educacional de Fernandópolis for a bachelor's degree in System of Information.

Currently I spend some of my time at my own company - Bras Sun - crafting unique, beautiful & custom solutions in the form of software. I also roam at [Dito Internet][dito], a company specialized in customer retention.

I've spoken in many events and am a proud member of the [NoSQL Summer][nsummer].

In my day-to-day life, I work with Ruby on Rails, MongoDB and PostgreSQL, but I don't limit myself to those technologies. I like to solve my problems using the best tools for the job. And I give back something good to the community contributing to the various open source projects I use.


And last but not least, I have a lovely wife - Taisa.
