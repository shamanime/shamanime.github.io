## Hello! My name is Jefferson Queiroz Venerando.

I live in São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Brazil.

I am a former founder of [Bras Sun], a development and digital marketing agency that had it's doors open in 2011. That's where I used to roam most part of my day taking care of software development and every other technical thing to do.

Now, I work at [Sisprev], building a software that is The Next Thing (tm) for Social Security Institutes.

I also speak in some events and am a proud member of the [NoSQL Summer][nsummer].

In my day life, I work with Ruby on Rails, MongoDB and PostgreSQL, but I don't limit myself to those technologies. I like to solve my problems using the best tools for the job. And I give back something good to the community contributing to the various open source projects I use.

I graduated in System of Information in the end of 2011 at the Fundação Educacional de Fernandópolis.

And last but not least, I have a lovely wife - Taisa.
